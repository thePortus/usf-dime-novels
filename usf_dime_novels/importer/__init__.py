=============================== Importer Module ===============================

The importer module is designed to make use of .CSV data dumps that have
previously been exported using the exporter module. It should only be used on
an empty database, or if you know the data being imported has not already been
added to the current database. The importer module does not perform any of the
initial data gathering, which is done by the scraper module.
