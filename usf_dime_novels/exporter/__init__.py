=============================== Exporter Module ===============================

The exporter module performs dB .csv dumps to allow for backup/importation. It
also provides functions to export various joined views of database data for
use elsewhere (e.g. text analysis or visualization programs). By default, it
will store all data in a subdirectory named 'output' inside the current working
directory. If the folder does not already exist, it will create it.
